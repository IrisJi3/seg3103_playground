### Java

I am running Java openjdk 11

```bash
C:\Users\xiash>java --version
openjdk 11.0.10 2021-01-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9, mixed mode)
```

To run the Java program (in `newmath_java`), first I compile it

```bash
javac seg3103/seg3103_playground/newmath_java/src/*.java
```
Then I run it

```bash
java -cp ./dist Main
```
Here is an output of the running program

```bash
Newmath (type 'exit' to exit program)
Numerator: 10
Demoninator: 5
10 / 5 = 2
Numerator: 20
Demoninator: 6
20 / 6 = 3
Numerator: exit
```

### JUnit

I am working with JUnit 5 (via Console standalone 1.7.1)

To run JUnit, I need to compile the application (see above), and then compile the test code

```bash
javac -cp dist;lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar test/*.java
```

Then I run the tests using

```
java -jar lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar --class-path dist --scan-class-path
```

Here is the output of the tests

```bash
Thanks for using JUnit! Support its development at https://junit.org/sponsoring

### Elixir

I am running Elixir 11.4 with Erlang 23

```bash
elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 21 [erts-10.3] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1]

Elixir 1.11.4 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 21)
```

To run the Elixir program (in `newmath_ex`), first I compile it

```bash
mix compile
```

Then I run it

```bash
iex -S mix
```

Here is an output of the running program

```elixir
iex(1)> NewmathEx.
MixProject    div/2
iex(1)> NewmathEx.div(10, 2)
{:ok, 5.0}
```

### ExUnit

ExUnit is built directly into Elixir (and compiled like above with `mix compile`)

To run the tests

```
mix test
```

Here is the output of the tests

```bash
Compiling 1 file (.ex)
Generated newmath_ex app
...
