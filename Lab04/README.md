### Elixir

I am running Elixir 12.0 with Erlang 22

```bash
elixir --version
```
![version](assets/elixir-version.JPG)

To run the Elixir program (in `fizzbuzz` and `tic`), first I compile it

```bash
mix compile
```

Then I run it

```bash
iex -S mix
```

Here is an output of the running program with a screenshot from the terminal

### ExUnit

ExUnit is built directly into Elixir (and compiled like above with `mix compile`)

To run the tests

```
mix test
```

Here is the output of the tests, with a screenshot from the terminal

## Test Driven Development

To compile:

    javac -encoding UTF-8 --source-path test -d dist -cp lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar test/*.java src/*.java

Then run the tests:

```
java -jar lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar --class-path dist --scan-class-path
```


### Commit 1 - test_defaultBoard():

function of default_Board() creates a 3x3 2D array with all elements are "_".

Make it fail first by using "0" instead of "_".

### Commit 3 - test_emptyBoard():

Here is to test if the shape of board is correct. 

First, Failed by let emptyBoard() create a 2x3 array and test with a 3x3 array:
![TDD](assets/fail3.JPG)

Then, match both:
![TDD](assets/pass3.JPG)

Here is the commit of 3nd group:

Each array should have the same size in board. If the board is not square, the test fails:
