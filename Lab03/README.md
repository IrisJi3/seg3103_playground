## Report
### Environment equipment

To use Jacoco, we need to fix the version of eclipse from JRE to JDK, so I downloaded JDK for Jacoco.

Then made the right configurations.

Finally, run the code given us.

This is all the environment preparation we made.

### Exercise
To compile the application:     
      
          javac -encoding UTF-8 --source-path src -d dist src/*.java

To compile the tests

    javac -encoding UTF-8 --source-path test -d dist -cp lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar test/*.java src/*.java

To run the agent

    java -javaagent:lib/jacocoagent.jar -jar lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar --class-path dist --scan-class-path

before adding any tests, I ran the Jcoco for the tests that were given, and I got the following results

To generate a report

    java -jar lib/jacococli.jar report jacoco.exec --classfiles dist --sourcefiles src --html report

To open the report
    
      ./report/index.html

report for date.java class is this:

To do the exercise, we import the Date file.\

![dateoriginal](Asset/DateOriginal.png)

You can see the percentage is 84.2 and Date class has the percentage of 79.9. Now we are going to fix code.

After trying to achieve 100% coverage, I fixed code many times, while it does not improved and achieve 71%. Thus, I think this case has been perfect and it is not possible to achieve 100%.
