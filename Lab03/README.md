## Report
### Environment equipment
To use Jacoco, we need to fix the version of eclipse from JRE to JDK, so I downloaded JDK for Jacoco.

Then made the right configurations.

Finally, run the code given us.

This is all the environment preparation we made.

### Exercise
To do the exercise, we import the Date file.\

![dateoriginal](Asset/DateOriginal.png)

You can see the percentage is 84.2 and Date class has the percentage of 79.9. Now we are going to fix code.

After trying to achieve 100% coverage, I fixed code many times, while it does not improved and achieve 71%. Thus, I think this case has been perfect and it is not possible to achieve 100%.
