download Maven and install by the instruction at https://maven.apache.org/install.html. Here is the Maven version:
```bash

```

### mvn compile
```bash
mvn compile
```

![maven](assets/compile1-2.JPG)

### mvn package DskipTests
Then compile all of the tests without running them:
```bash
mvn package -DskipTests
```
![maven](assets/compile2.JPG)

It packages all project files into one jar file: BookstoreApp-0.1.0.jar:

### java -jar ./target/BookstoreApp-0.1.0.jar
```bash
java -jar ./target/BookstoreApp-0.1.0.jar
```
![maven](assets/jar1.JPG)

http://localhost:8080 didn't work:

Then, after referring to ..\seg3103_playground\Lab06\BookstoreApp\src\main\java\main\App.java, it used a different jar file:
```bash
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("java", "-jar", "bookstore5.jar");
```

So, used 
```bash
java -jar bookstore5.jar
```
![maven](assets/jar3.JPG)

Now it worked:

```
