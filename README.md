### Java

I am running Java openjdk 11

```bash
C:\Users\xiash>java --version
openjdk 11.0.10 2021-01-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9, mixed mode)
```

To run the Java program (in `newmath_java`), first I compile it

```bash
javac seg3103/seg3103_playground/newmath_java/src/*.java
```
Then I run it

```bash
java Main
```
Here is an output of the running program

```bash
Newmath (type 'exit' to exit program)
Numerator: 10
Demoninator: 5
10 / 5 = 2
Numerator: 20
Demoninator: 6
20 / 6 = 3
Numerator: exit
```
