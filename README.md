### Java

I am running Java openjdk 11

```bash
C:\Users\xiash>java --version
openjdk 11.0.10 2021-01-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9, mixed mode)
```

To run the Java program (in `newmath_java`), first I compile it

```bash
javac seg3103/seg3103_playground/newmath_java/src/*.java
```
Then I run it

```bash
java -cp ./dist Main
```
Here is an output of the running program

```bash
Newmath (type 'exit' to exit program)
Numerator: 10
Demoninator: 5
10 / 5 = 2
Numerator: 20
Demoninator: 6
20 / 6 = 3
Numerator: exit
```

### JUnit

I am working with JUnit 5 (via Console standalone 1.7.1)

To run JUnit, I need to compile the application (see above), and then compile the test code

```bash
javac -cp dist;lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar test/*.java
```

Then I run the tests using

```
java -jar lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar --class-path dist --scan-class-path
```

Here is the output of the tests

```bash
Thanks for using JUnit! Support its development at https://junit.org/sponsoring
