### System

Windows 10

### setup
run the following code in grade folder:
```bash
mix deps.get
cd assets && npm install
```
![version](assets/deps-get.JPG)
![version](assets/npm-install.JPG)

Then we can run
```bash
mix phx.server
```
and login http://localhost:4000/:
![version](assets/grade.JPG)

### Stub
There is an error occurred when open http://localhost:4000/ and the button did't work. CMD showed that "function Grades.Calculator.letter_grade/1 is undefined (module Grades.Calculator is not available)". After checking page_live.ex, the module name should be Grades.Calculator. Then, according to TA, adding random number for each function to see if it works:
![part1](assets/random.JPG)

And it works now:

Then, replace the code with assignment2. Run again. Here is Arithmatic error occured (complain module page_live.ex at 3rd parameter of function handle_event - socket)
![part1](assets/error.JPG)

According to page_live.ex, the socket read input of tuples, so the function avg does not work (also shown in CMD: "State: %{components: {%{}, %{}, 1}, join_ref: "4", serializer: Phoenix.Socket.V2.JSONSerializer, socket: #Phoenix.LiveView.Socket<assigns: %{flash: %{}, grades: %{final: nil, homework: [], labs: [], midterm: nil}, ...")
![part1](assets/socket.JPG)

### Mocks
Use the code of mock_partial_object() to implement the 4 missing test cases in TwitterTest.java. Run the test without any change in Twitter.java. 
```bash
java --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED -jar lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar -cp dist;lib/easymock-4.3.jar;lib/objenesis-3.2.jar --scan-class-path
```
Here is the result:

![test](assets/junit.JPG)

According to the error message, the error occurred in isMentionned_dontReturnSubstringMatches(), " expected: <false> but was: <true>".  This is because  "meat" contains "me", so no matter if the loadTweet return @meat or @me. isMentionned("me") will always be true. Therefore, we need to change the code of isMentioned() in Twitter.java to ensure string after "@" should 100% match. We use equals() instead of contains():

run again, it works:
